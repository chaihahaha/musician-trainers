When you hear the letter name of a note, find it on the guitar fretboard and play it. You can decide which string to play by yourself. I suggest practing one string at a time, when you are familiar with the position of notes, you can decide the string of the note randomly or follow some rules. All in all, you can obtain a letter name range from A to G, you can practice in any way as you want.
